To TA:

1. index.html is the home page
2. Website is a redesign of the MINDS Singapore website, original link is here: http://www.minds.org.sg/index.html. 
I also have a Medium post on my writeup about the whole process of redesigning, from wireframing to decision making in choosing which pages to redesign (due to time and in part the assignment requirements)
3. You can locate the CSS in the /css folder, where all the stylesheets are. As I used CDN, only customized styles appear here. /js is where you can locate all relevant JS, and form validation.
4. References taken to the Bootstrap 3 official documentation and MINDS website, and Brad Frost's website for good web design practices :)
