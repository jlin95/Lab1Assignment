To TA:

1. index.html is the home page
2. Website is a redesign of the MINDS Singapore website, original link is here: http://www.minds.org.sg/index.html. 
I also have a Medium post on my writeup about the whole process of redesigning, from wireframing to decision making in choosing which pages to redesign (due to time and in part the assignment requirements)
3. You can locate the CSS in the /css folder, where all the stylesheets are. As I used CDN, only customized styles appear here. /js is where you can locate all relevant JS, and form validation. Some effects like collapsing are done within the html pages themselves.
4. References taken to the Bootstrap 3 official documentation and MINDS website, and Brad Frost's website for web design practices. Image credits to MINDS Singapore Facebook page and off Google Images too, where MINDS is relevant..


Note: To view the site as it is + for optimal effects, please run them locally in /Lab1Assignment with python -m SimpleHTTPServer. If it loads Arial font, please let me know as that's not what it's supposed to show! Thank you :)
